		<p id="p1">In this weeks lab, I needed to create file structure,
			and add index.html files to our lab 3 folder.
			Luckly enough we have a professor that hooked it up!

	<h2 style="text-align:center">Challenges</h2>
		<p id="p2"> My biggest challenge in the beginning was trying to link an img file. It took a while to figure out how to link the file.
			When I finally figured it out and was all excited,
			I noticed that when I committed it to master the links didn't show up on my actual website, only locally.
			I understand that the current link isn't correct,
			but when I do the img/ one it won't show up either.
			I then started to mess with css. Things weren't working. I couldn't find the lecture video for it neither.
			I started to worry because I wasn't sure if I could get it working.
			So I back tracked and realized I was working under the wrong folder. That simple.</p>
