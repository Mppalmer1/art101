        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>There weren't that many challenges that we encountered. Thanks to the console, we were able to debug and fix our lab 10.</p>





    <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>Again, we did not have any problems and we were able to complete the debug without running into any problems. This lab was pretty straight forward and was a complete breeze.</p>
