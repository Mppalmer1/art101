   <h1> Lab 8 Anon Functions and Callbacks </h1>

   <h2> Challenges </h2>
   <p> We didn't have any challenges since we were able to use follow the tasks accordingly. We do need more practice configuring our callbacks. </p>

    <h2> Problems </h2>
    <p> We had a couple challenges in this lab but nothing major. One challenge that we had had is connecting our JS file into our index but we resolved this by using output as the id name. Another challenge that we had was getting the right CSS into our index.
      We were able to use the inspect tool to configure exactly what style we wanted for our page.  </p>

    <h2> Results </h2>
    <p> Here are our results at the bottom. You can also check out our results in the console on the right. </P>
