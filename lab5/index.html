        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>We had a bit of a hard time getting our Script to link onto our index from the javascript file.
            We think it was becasue the document.writeln was written with a capital L instead of a lowercase l.
            We also had a hard time trying to format our text onto or page with the propper padding.
            It took us a while but we were able to figure out exactly how we wanted our text to be formated on the page.


        </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>Here is our finished index file for lab 5.
        In this file, we were able to create text within or borders so that it could be visually pleasing. We were able to link the javascript and CSS that we created.
        We were able to overcome all of our challenges by looking at the turorials on code academy. A screenshot of our codeing will be provided in our lab submission. </p>
